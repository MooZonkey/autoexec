     //I'm entirely aware the server controls the value, and most servers will default cl_interp to .0152X. 
    //Value typically ranges from .0152 to .0333, and up to .0666 for horrible connections. 
   //Setting this any higher really doesn't make sense.

 //It ultimately comes down to preference.
