I have been working on this project for a long time now. 
If you are experiencing network issues, please download and use one of the supplemental networking cfg files here:
https://github.com/MooZonkey/autoexec-supplementary-scripts


Keep in mind that two networking modules cannot be executed at once. Using more than 1 of the networking modules will result in the cvars (settings) being overridden by whichever script executes last. 
Retain only the desired networking module. Delete the other one(s). 




The remainder of this readme section will serve as a repository for my perosnal favorite configuration changes to TF2.
