//This module fixes the map voting fix bug. Fairly seamless integration, unless you already have binds asigned to num1, 2, or 3.  
//Numlock must be enabled for this to function. 

bind kp_end next_map_vote 0

bind kp_downarrow next_map_vote 1

bind kp_pgdn next_map_vote 2

//Press num1 for the first map starting from the left,
//numpad2 for the second, and numpad 3 for the third map.
